            Hi!
            <br/><br/>
                This is a personal project which I've worked on for about 10 months.
            <br/>
                It is a program which attempts to estimate how similar two c# functions are in terms of their functionality.
            <br/>
            <br/>
                It produces a similarity score between 0 and 1, where a higher score means the functions are more closely related.
           <br/>
                In addition, another score is calculated which conveys how well one function contains some of the functionality of the other,
            <br />
                i.e. how well one function can use the other and still preform the same actions.
            <br/>
            <br/>
                I'd be happy if you could help me test it out!
            <br/>

            <br/>           
                I would also greatly appreciate any feedback.
            <br/><br/>
                Thanks!
